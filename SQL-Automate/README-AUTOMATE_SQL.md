Information Regarding the SQL-Automate Folder: 
This Folder contains all the files required to create a SQL source database that is used to keep track of the various open-source databases that the individual property keys within SPOKE come from. We recently noticed that there are several nodes within SPOKE that may have multiple sources, and while we do recognize that there is a way to add multiple sources delimited by commas, for future purposes (as we begin to add increasingly more nodes), it would be better to have a SQL instance that keeps a track of these sources. The code utilizes a smart key that is made up of the property key ID along with the node uuid (generated using the graphaware-uuid package - can be found at: https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-uuid). This should also make it easier for the GraphDB to be easily updated for only those property keys/nodes that require updating after a signficant database (such as DrugBank, UniProt or ChEMBL) goes through a periodic update.
