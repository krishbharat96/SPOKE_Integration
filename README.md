# SPOKE Integration
This repository focuses on the integration of various Chemical and Biological Databases into the SPOKE (formerly known as Hetio) database. This is a heterogenous biomedical knowledge network created by Daniel Himmelstein. Credits to Dr. Himmelstein for his incredible work with this network! Details of his work (SPOKE v1.0) can be found at: het.io. He also has a github page (https://github.com/dhimmel/hetionet) that details code used to create SPOKE from scratch. Under the guidance of Dr. Baranzini at UCSF, I am currently working on adding to this network by integrating more databases such as ChEMBL and UniProt. We are also looking to add therapeutic prediction algorithms from the Keiser Lab at UCSF (known as the SEA Algorithm), and from the Bhandyoypadhay Lab (known as the MAGNETIC algorithm) in an effort to expand upon this network's prediction capabilities. We are also working with the RBVI at UCSF on ways to create ways to automatically update the SPOKE network as newer versions of the open-source databases we are pulling data from get released.
